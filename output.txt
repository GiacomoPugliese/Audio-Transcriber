Good morning.
 They were going to be talkin about consideration the element of consideration.
 And the reason that we're going to be having this discussion is because as you know consideration is one of those four elements for like all the big four that are always necessary to have a contract they always have to be present if we're going to have a contract.
 And so far the test that we've been dressing is the question of recognizing win a contract exist, because after all the contract is a binding agreement, it creates rights and obligations. If there is no contract then there are no rights and obligations people are free to do what they want at the end of the last class. Someone sad that you're not got a lease with the landlord which is simply a form of contract and the lease say a one year lease and the rent is $500. And now the landlord wants to increase the rent to $600. Do I have a right to keep paying 500 plus another way of saying do we have an agreement or do I have a binding agreement with the landlord to rent that particular apartment paying $500 a month for the following year?
 What is Bonnie agreement it means that you have the legal right to occupy that come assist for the. Time one year paying that amount of rent. The landlord has the obligation to provide that apartment to someone that you have the obligation to pay that rent in the landlord has the right to recover that rent. That's what a binding agreement is all about. And so if there is a valid lease which is a valid contract then yes, certainly. You have the right to remain in that apartment for the 1-year. Paying that rent and the fact of the landlord would like to have more ranch or you might like to pay less rent is really not relevant in a legal sense. You have a legal right to that apartment that rent and the landlord has a legal obligation to provide it to you. And if one of you breaks that contract Break Stuff on your agreement, then the victim of that breach can sue
 Person who has broken the contract and recover damages Financial damages that you suffered. So you see that this concept of contract is something that as I was saying earlier is ubiquitous. It's all around you if you're renting an apartment. If you are making any kind of purchase these contract rules apply and they inform you of your right which is of course very important because if you don't know what your rights are, then you have no way of exercising them. So get back to Army point.
 How do we know that a contract a binding agreement exists? Well first we look at the four Essential Elements to see whether they're there if one of those is missing that could be no contract. Nobody has any rights or obligations in connection with that the issue legality capacity consideration and agreement your Mantra with respect to contract. We have to have the County mental capacity. We have to have mutual consideration and we have to have agreement and as we know from the last two class actions this agreement has to be arrived at in a very special way what I've called the dance that has to be offered its effective and accepts the fact that the come together kind of like the sperm and the Egg to form a contract.
 So the first thing we do we look at the gallery capacity consideration and agreement consideration is one of these and the entire class today is going to be devoted to gaining a better understanding of consideration so that you will be able to recognize when consideration is present and therefore a contract exist or maybe where it's at 10th. And therefore there is no contract. First of all consideration has to be mutual that is each party say the buyer and the seller for landlord and attendant each party to the contract must receive something of value that also exchange something of value. So the foot that has to be this flowing in each direction from they say the fire to the seller from the seller to the buyers of something of value. So if you're going to buy say off a watch and you going to pay $50 for it, you are receiving the watch which is something of value you're giving up $50.
 The value there is this Mutual exchange also importantly the consideration has to be bargained for bargain for that means each party is only giving up. What is what it is giving up in exchange for the other party giving up its consideration. So if I'm buying the watch I'm saying to the to the vendor the watch I'm saying, okay, I will pay you $50 if you will transfer ownership and possession of the watch to me is a bargain for exchange as opposed to say an exchange Mutual exchange of gifts. For example, let's say that you're a good friend of mine and I say to you not noticed that your watch is broken. I have six watches so I got like to give you my watch is a present. That's a gift.
 And to the gift, it's that the consideration flows only one way. I'm giving you something of value to watch. I'm not getting anything from you in return. I'm not bargaining for anything return until they given you the watch nothing in return.
 And then you might say fine. That's great. And I hand you the watch and you say me. Well, you know, I really appreciate this and I do know my watch is broken and my finances aren't very good. But I'd like to do something for you in return. I'm going to wash your car and I sell it for a nice of you. Thank you. But what we have here is an exchange of that. It was washing my car has value, but it was not bargain for
 I didn't say to you. I will exchange my watch in exchange for you washing my car that would be bargained for.
 And it is straight and I gave I made you a gift you made me another gift even though there is some value flowing both directions. It was not bargain for so that has to be this Mutual exchange of value. It has to be bargained for and sometimes when we look at Value we ask well is the thing is the consideration item to watch the money. Whatever it is. Is it a benefit to the person receive. At a detriment to the person giving it up the so-called benefit from a test. That's one way of determining whether the item of consideration has a value basic idea behind consideration and everything else we're going to talk about for the rest of the class is sort of an elaboration and we will go also look at some specific problem issues that arise in connection with consideration. Just make sure that everybody is clear on these Basics trap. Somebody has a question. I'd like to ask
 The first thing is sometimes causes some misunderstanding or confusion is the issue of under number. One of the electron forbearance has consideration. First of all, what is forbearance the word for Bear means to not do something in the example. I gave her earlier where there's an exchange of the watch for say the money in the in the watch store. Each party is giving up something positive to watching something positive the money or something positive and typically with consideration. Each party is giving up something positive of value value to the other.
 However, sometimes one of the parties to the transaction can be giving up not something positive but the absence of something.
 Not doing something.
 Classic example is in settlement of a potential lawsuit. Let's say for example that it's winter and there's ice on the on the sidewalk and dog.
 You slip and fall on the sidewalk in front of my house. Now. I have a legal obligation to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition. And so you think, maybe you should bring a lawsuit against me because you claimed that it was icy. And I that ice was there for several days and I should have crate off by then. And so you're thinking about bringing a lawsuit against me which you might win. So you have a perfectly legal right to bring this lawsuit if you want because you fell there's a there's a basis for your lawsuit. It's a legitimate claim doesn't automatically mean you're going to win but there's a legitimate basis for your lawsuit. Maybe you come to me and tell me what you thinking about doing. I say, well, why don't we settle this without a lawsuit? I don't think I'm responsible really because I don't think I was that bad, but I can see your point and I'll tell you what, I'll pay you $500.
 If and that's my consideration if you will forbear.
 If you will not do something namely not bring your lawsuit against me. So the consideration that I'm giving him his contract is a contract to settle the potential claim you have my consideration is $500 that's positive consideration. Clearly it has value.
 Your consideration is your forbearance. You're not doing something named will you're not bringing a lawsuit against me now, when is forbearance with consideration because the law says a full parent is not always be consideration.
 the rulers that forbearance not doing something is good legal consideration if
 The action that is being for born is an action that the party was legally entitled to do.
 So if you were legally entitled if you have a legal right to bring this lawsuit, which you did you're giving out your legal, right? Your forbearance is good legal consideration. And so your forbearance to bring your lawsuit is good consideration. My foot. My $500 would be consideration. There is mutual consideration is bargained for and so the consideration element has been satisfied and if the legality capacity in agreement there also satisfied in proper formation has occurred and if we need a writing if we have it, then we have the binding to a contract and we are both bound to that agreement.
 We are committed to it and down to it.
 On the other hand, let's take a look at forbearance where the forbearance is not good legal considerations name me a situation where the person who is forbearing does not have the legal right to do the action. Let's say that
 but say that you are.
 19 years old in a state where the legal drinking age for alcohol is 21
 Is that situation you do not have a legal right to drink alcohol?
 What color is it? You have an uncle who is concerned about your health and your welfare and your uncle becomes aware that you've been drinking and so your uncle captures. I have a deal for you.
 I will write it out to sign it a nice piece of paper. The deal is that if you agree not to drink any alcohol at all to totally abstain from alcohol for the next 6 months.
 Said I will pay your tuition for the next two years at the University of Idaho.
 Do you think yourself all sounds like a pretty good deal and you agree to it? And you and your uncle put down in writing and you both sign the writing. This was the agreement that if you abstain from alcohol for next 6 months, Bianca will pay for the rest of your tuition for the University of Idaho for the next 2 years.
 Let's say that any other way of testing it. Let's say that you agree that you know, once once a week you will be tested for alcohol in your bloodstream. And you do that and you're tested for the next 6 months and the test show there's no alcohol and you truly have refrain from alcohol you have before born from drinking alcohol for the 6 months.
 I can do a 6-month. To go are y'all going to say well here is all the be a lab test affirming that I did not have a call and I'll tell you I do not have any alcohol and I appreciate this very much and I look forward to you paying my tuition cuz I could really need the money working and it's hard for me to pay for my education.
 What if the uncle says that's fine, no problem and whether or not it was a legal contract and whether or not your promise was good consideration. Will your forbearance is good consideration? Is it relevant Yonkers going to do it because your uncle feels don't go wants to but
 Contracts become important if somebody changes his or her mind what if the uncle I say pays one semester of your tuition and then for the next three semesters refuses to I don't want to pay for the rest of your your your time even though I've agreed to it, even though I have a ride and you can find it. I'm not going to honor my promise.
 If you want the Soothie uncle and you might not want to see Uncle goes after all it's your uncle. But let's assume that what if you didn't want to see the uncle is the uncle's promise to pay for the for the other three semesters of year tuition at University of Ohio. Is that a binding promise? Can you enforce that promise? Can you if necessary, so your uncle for the value of that tuition over those three semesters in the same way. We answer the question about the landlord and tenant issues with the rent that we talked about a few minutes ago. If your uncle's promise to pay two years of your tuition at the University if that promise is part of a contract that mean it's part of a binding agreement.
 And your uncle is found.
 How do we know whether a binding contract agreement? How do we know whether account or I can just well we look at legality compassion cancellation agreement. The other things right now is just focus on the consideration and see whether this consideration their there certainly is a writing. So sign no problem there. It's a legal agreement with the drinks on my busy lady legal for the agreement was to not drink. So we have the Gaudi you have mental capacity. Nobody's a child or or unable to understand a person having a green mint. The one element is unclear is whether or not there is consideration. So the uncles consideration consists of his promise to pay two years of tuition. That's a pretty sizable promise is a promise to pay quite a substantial amount of money. Certainly that promise has value.
 Promise was bargain for because after all you made the promise in exchange for the uncles, so it's a bargain for promised. So they are girls promise to pay two years of tuition certainly is good legal consideration for remember that consideration. I feel Mutual consideration flowing from each party to the other. What is the value? What is a consideration that you gave to your uncle in exchange? Well, you gave your promise that you would not drink alcohol.
 However, remember that in order for forbearance, which is what you promised to give is your forbearance denoted for forbearance to be good legal consideration. It must be forbearance from something you had a legal right to do.
 So, did you have a legal right to drink alcohol?
 No, and therefore your forbearance is not good legal consideration. Therefore there is no Mutual consideration. So we would have to conclude that the consideration element does not exist in this agreement there for one of the big four elements is missing.
 What we have is not a contract. It's not a binding agreement and therefore no legal rights. No legal obligations were created and you have no legal right to enforce your uncle's promise not to pay the next three semesters of tuition.
 If I can look at item to a gift promise.
 I guess promise is one which where one party makes available promise. There's no consideration as to return and because there's no mutuality of consideration gift promises are not mind it so it we have a gift promise one-party promise to do something for the other without any return the value those promises are not enforceable.
 Are you under 30 start for questions? Maybe somebody has placed upon what you've said so far.
 Okay, I'm not yes.
 Omega can you use promissory estoppel?
 You know the answer is yes, however promissory estoppel and think of a quasi contract. These are Equitable remedies.
 They're really not the traditional part of a common-law. They're overly wrong. We talked about the relationship between common law and equity.
 Equitable remedies do exist for those very rare situations to win applying the common law or rule will result in an obvious serious Injustice. So they're shaved for where you where situations are particularly their save for situations where the promised T has substantially relied to deck to his detriment on the promise. So yes promissory estoppel could make the uncles promise enforceable, but only if the requirements commissary stop with a present and they're very strict and very rear but since you bring it up, let's discuss this situation when when the remedy might be applied. Let me emphasize again that the Ecuador Equitable remedies like promissory estoppel are very rare their unusual to 99.8.
 CV cases the common law rules will be used the act of a portable rules will not be.
 Your uncle promises not to pay your tuition for the next two years, but instead your uncle promises that when you graduate your uncle will give you a his farm. Got a nice Thousand Acre Farm.
 Now you receive if you cuz you give up your smoking or you're drinking whatever it is.
 So you're 19 and you give up the drinking but we know that that forbearance has knocked a little consideration shown to the common law. You have no rights as no contract. You're out under the common law you would lose. If you try to force that let's say that you don't you don't drink but then but then when you graduate the uncle doesn't want to give you the farm changed his mind. Can you enforce the promise to give you the farm under this Equitable doctrine of promissory estoppel? Well, let's say that in the situation that your uncle has no children, No other heirs really other than you so it's kind of a logical thing that your uncle would maybe leave it to you in his will or pass it on to you.
 Fairview uncle has been very reliable in the past that have made promises to you in the past and always carry them through and so it's reasonable for you to rely to believe a promise and rely on it's a reasonable thing. They promised to give me that farm. He stopped drinking The Stranger original person would not rely on that cuz the person but does your uncle always been very good to always follow through on his promises. So you rely and your alliances reasonable, that's the first requirement of a promissory estoppel.
 And you rely by changing your major. Let's say that you were a until your business major. Maybe you were a marketing major and you change your major so I can get the form to change your major to I have skills to operate the front. So you be you get a degree in agriculture instead of say marketing.
 In addition you work Summers for no wages on the farm figuring you'll improve the farm so that you know, when you graduate in two years it'll be in better shape. So you work for no wages in you and some of your money to improve the farm.
 So what you've done is you have reasonably relied on the promise you've acted in a way that if the promises not kept you will be substantially worse off you'll suffer. We call a substantial detriment of the elements required for, so I stopped and Thomas or stock number is one of the equity remedies based upon the idea of fairness and you would say that because I relied my Reliance was reasonable and I would suffer great financial harm at the promises not kept it will be very unfair not to enforce you a promise and probably I wouldn't say certainly but probably a court would apply promissory estoppel and enforce the uncle promised basement, because we have these are unusual circumstances of reasonable Reliance severe financial documents and unfairness.
 That promissory estoppel will will be used but it's kind of weird thing. It's only for those rare situations were obviously the unjust and unfair not to enforce the promised Neverland a 99.8 or so percent in the vast majority of cases to court to go to use the common law rules under the common law rules that much more mechanical. You got to have a b c and d d classic Solutions what I was missing no contractor out no remedy and that's what's going to happen in 99 % Thank you for that.
 Okay, I remember three adequacy.
 What if this exchange of values this Mutual exchange of consideration involves consideration that is of unequal value?
 But I have his car.
 I'm outside at the market value of the car is $10,000 and you and I agree that I will sell it to you for $5,000.
 cars worth 10,000
 so my consideration is worth twice as much as the consideration that you're giving me an exchange for it.
 In a situation like that, we would say.
 That your consideration of only 5000 we have to value is not adequate.
 It's another way of saying that.
 The value is not equal and your value is less less equal less valuable than my consideration.
 So in this exchange this agreement to sell you my $10,000 car for 5000 your considerations inadequate no question about that.
 The question is what is the legal significance?
 How's this inadequate consideration of this unequal value and the answer may surprise you.
 the wiggle significance is 0
 as long as it's
 they may think well, that's pretty strange. Why would the law want to confirm and enforce an unfair bargain?
 Because that's what's going to be happening. If all together, I went to the concert at present. We have it binding agreement in a foursome agreement. That is truly unfair why would a long one on force and unfair?
 Call transaction.
 the answer is that
 if it was a requirement that all transactions had to be fair.
 that would mean that the court would have to
 analyze and approve each and every transaction just for fairness.
 A huge burden on the courts, which I don't want to do further more the courts want to give freedom to the individuals freedom to the parties freedom to you to decide. What's fair as long as you decide its Fair.
 That's good enough in terms of the consideration element.
 also
 If the law required fairness that is equal value in the exchange then anybody who may be later on realize that he or she got the short end of the deal would want to go to court to undo the transaction. And again the huge burden on the courts and bind and contracts are no longer be binding tape will be going back later to claim that it was unfair.
 So as a practical matter at all stars, a matter of giving all of us Freedom School the freedom of contract.
 The legal rule is that adequacy or equal value or fairness is not a consideration.
 Not a concern.
 As long as the consideration has some value.
 That will satisfy the consideration requirement as long as it's mutual as long as bargained for that's all we need. We don't have to have equal value.
 So how do you say is not necessary?
 4 satisfy the consideration element in in contract law car and I agree to sell to you for $100.
 How tall is bought a car for $100 what's going on there?
 Well, the car has value you hundred dollar has value. Something is bargain for the consideration element has been satisfied.
 What are the case like that where?
 The values are so unequal. So obviously on equal.
 This raises other questions. Mainly why would I be willing to sell a car that's obviously worth many thousands of dollars only for $100. Why would I do that?
 I'm sure we would look for a reason.
 And we would find a reason cuz if there's a reason that what we might find for example, is that perhaps I lack mental capacity. Maybe you know, maybe my mind is just gone and I thought that was a fair price for the car or maybe I was under the influence of a drug might be a legal drug or alcohol. Maybe I was intoxicated and again no mental capacity.
 Or maybe I was a child and I didn't understand the value of cars or maybe you threatened me that if I didn't agree to this transaction, you would burn my house down or something like that, which is coercion. So there could be some other legal reason that would disqualify that agreement for being an enforceable contract and I would not be bound to deliver the car for $2 if something else is wrong and it probably is something else wrong if I ever agreed to sell you my $10,000 car for $100.
 What the reason this agreement would not be binding. The reason that we do not have an enforceable contract here is not the lack of adequacy. That's not the problem. The problem is the other thing whatever the other thing is such as intoxication or or whatever as long as the consideration I'm giving up have some value as long as a consideration you're giving up at Sun Valley as long as it was bargain for that satisfies a consideration element.
 What about buying a $10,000 car? Okay, why are you only a hundred bucks to get rid of it? And it turns out that something's wrong with that. You drive it a mile away from the engine blows up for trying to get rid of it knowing that it has his problem and maybe has a legal obligation to disclose it and fails to disclose that gets into the question of we called misrepresentation, which is a good tissue and it isn't an issue going to talk about at some length in in a future class. If one party has deceived the other party with respect to the transaction that makes the contract voidable is not binding on the party that was deceived. So good point and we will explore that a greater greater length in the future.
 all the questions on adequacy
 phone number for is pre-existing Duty.
 Sometimes August comes up.
 It's a situation where?
 For example, let's say you have an employee but tell you the president of a corporation and you have a employee that's been working for the corporation for 40 years.
 40 years and has risen from Stockholm or stock girl follow up to vice president.
 Still that's happened next to the so-called American dream, and it does happen.
 It was our meeting about recently with was that you'll see those kind of situations.
 Okay, so now here's the vice president. Let's go vice president June. Thanks. She's retired at the 40 years.
 El Castillo
 And I will I'm going to have a like a retirement dinner for her and at the retirement dinner and make a speech and in the speech eyesight, I turn to Joan Ice Age on that you've given forty years of your life. If you dedicate your professional life to this corporation's give added value to his value to the corporation and in appreciation for that and in consideration of your 40 years of service, we're going to buy you and give you a brand new Mercedes automobile Mercedes some modeling expensive Mercedes model that cost like $80,000.
 In consideration for your terrific service over the last 40 years.
 Okay the next day you're the co you change your mind?
 You decide you don't want to give the Joan the car.
 Can Joan and force your promise does John have a legal right to have that car based upon your promise?
 But once again, if the promise is part of the contract is binding that's what contracts are legally binding agreements for demons consist of promises.
 so your promise is legally binding which means Jones has a legal right to enforce it on there, nor contract if
 We have a contract so we're back to both but we do do we have a contract? Well, let's take a look at the big for the gallon capacity cancellation agreement to have the gout. Is it legal to have an agreement where you agree to give a former employee for a retired employee a nice card nothing illegal about that. So we have the Gaudi.
 Call Cassie let's say that you weren't drunk or anything. So good mental capacity. You're over the age of 18. The show is Joan. So there's mental capacity.
 What about consideration?
 Your promise to give the new Mercedes.
 Certainly has value because a Mercedes $80,000 diable promise.
 What did Joan give you in exchange for that? Why you said that her consideration was her 40 Years of past service?
 But a new contract must consist of some new value that Joan is giving in exchange for the new car that you're giving to her. So what what did she promise to give you?
 In exchange for your promise to give her the $80,000 Mercedes.
 What happened in the past is water under the bridge. It's in the past doesn't count anymore consideration has to be something new in exchange for a new promise. So what new consideration is Joan giving up as a bargain for exchange for the Mercedes at your house and give her a buzz or anyting. Nobody can know big says anything and you're right. There's no consideration that Joan is giving and so your promise to buy the Mercedes for Joan is simply a gift promise is a promise without consideration and exchange gift promises are not enforceable cuz we need Mutual consideration.
 So once again, we have no Mutual consideration the consideration element, which requires Mutual consideration is lacking missing. There's no consideration be one of the essential elements are components of a contract is missing. There's no consideration in there for no contract.
 This is no contract. Your promise is legally worthless. It doesn't create any rights don't have no right to enforce it because there's no contract there. There is no consideration based upon your promise to give her the car and it's because of her past consideration of 40 years of service so past consideration.
 if not
 Not good consideration.
 questions about that and the same thing that I know before Craigslist in Duty, let's say that
 but say that you
 Also, did you have an employee?
 And the employee's job.
 is 2
 do the books maybe the employees accountant and the employees work responsibilities job responsibilities is to keep the accounting books for the firm. And you pay this employee again was calling Joan you pay her $5,000 a month to do that work.
 and
 Don't come to you one day and says let's say for example John. We have a one-year employment contract with John and your six months into the one-year contract and her compensation on the contract is $5,000 a month. John comes to you and says that you know, I'm doing all this work and I realize that most accounts doing this kind of work. It paid at least six thousand a month.
 I I think you should promise to pay me $6,000 a month. And you say to Joan. Okay. I promise to pay you $6,000 a month and $1,000 a month for your work.
 Sean says that's nice at the end of the month. When when you pay Joan the only pair the 5,000 because what's this you promise to pay 6000?
 Was your promise to pay the 6,000 extra thousand was it legally binding is John entitles their 2000 and cheese cereal necessary the collective $2,000 that you promised to pay her.
 But once again, how do we know whether a prom is enforceable? If it's part of the contract contract requires the gallon capacity consideration Mutual cancellation agreement.
 Can you use your consideration in this situation you promise to pay jonak 2000 dollars thousand dollars has value. So certainly your promise to pay extra thousand dollars is consideration. What about what did Joan promise to do? What she promised to continue doing? What she was already obligated to do Under the original contract.
 She's not doing anything in addition to what she had originally contracted to do namely keep the books. Keep up the accounting work on the books. So John has not given you anything new to once again psychopath consideration. She hasn't given me anything new because she already had this existing duty to keep up the books. But she says well when I'm giving you is my work to the books you can sit well with you were ready to do that job in Duty. So simply doing something at 1 or what he was previously obligated to do that's not new consideration and therefore Jones promise to keep doing the books is not consideration. Once again, there's no Mutual consideration. Your promise had value don't promise did not and so no Mutual consideration. The consideration element has not been satisfied enough with the consideration. What is missing no contract and so the promises involved and not legally binding and Joan cannot hold you to your promise to pay the extra.
 $1,000 she is still bound under the original contract to work for $5,000.
 Question. Yes.
 Writing writing is nice. If you need a writing remember is that not all contracts?
 Require a writing in order to be legally binding.
 Only important contracts with the whole class on this issue of the writing versus normal contract, but just as a overview only important contracts have to be in writing. So some contacts don't need a riding at all. But even if the contract does need a writing and we have a writing and it's all signed by everybody that satisfies the writing requirement but the ride requirement really secondary first, we have to have a contract oral contract what the writing does is it confirms the oral contract? So if we have no oil contract of nothing to concern and the oil contract requires all the elements the four elements legality capacity consideration and agreement so that consideration we have no oral contract and the writing becomes irrelevant because we don't have the oil contacted begin with the writing merely is there too concerned or contract. That's a good thought.
Just talked about a picnic company or a green play a pay a certain amount for plastic plates.
 And because the price of oil went up the cost to make the place went up also there for the plastic company calls the picnic company back cuz I can't give you the plastic plates for this amount of money. I need to ask more but because the picnic company agreed.
 Then therefore isn't are they bound is not a new contract, even though it wasn't in the original project. Now, that's a good question. But it raises a really a shepherd. And what have I to do is set that aside for a moment because first I'd like to get the basics out in the basic understood that we can take it a step further. So maybe after class we can talk about that because it raises really question, but it's really not not what we need to talk about right now. So hang on to that question. It's it's a good one.
 What I want to do now is talk about some exam problem situations involving consideration.
 And this will provide you with some useful information in situations that that that you will be involved in and that you can therefore use
 First of all, I didn't five the promise to hold an offer open.
 What is
 so you negotiating for the purchase of a car?
 can dog
 who would like to buy the car? I'm out of town. I'm the one the owner in the office or or I'll offer to sell it to the $5,000 and you would like to pay 5000 you happy to pay 5000. You would like to buy the car to $5,000.
 But you're not able to accept this offer right now because you don't have $5,000 in your bank account.
 You do have some assets that you think you can sell within about two weeks and raise the money, but no, you can't be positive that you can sell them within that two week. And so what you would like is for me to hold my offer open to for 2 weeks giving you an opportunity to raise the money and then if you raise the money you can accept and buy the car but on the other hand if you can't raise the money, you're not going to be bound. You not going to be committed in the contract. You're not going to have to pay damages for failure to go through with the transaction. So what you want is for me to hold my offer open to you for say two weeks.
 So what story you asked me that that you have to make the journey with your whole the offer open to me for two weeks, but I sure no problem.
 So I'm promising called off-road notice how this Compares with.
 A termination time state of the offer which makes son very similar, but it's very different legally. What if I say to you this awful automatically terminate to automatically die in two weeks.
 Amazon account I'm just saying it's going to die in 2 weeks. That way we avoid the reason will create a Time ruby discussed earlier. So if I say this how it was going to turn it into a kind of promised holder open, but if I promise to hold the offer open, that's a whole different story. I am committing to give you my promise that I will not revoke for 2 weeks.
 Now the question is is my promise to you legally binding.
 Stickers legally binding and I break the promise and you suffer a loss. You can sue me collect some damn just for me.
 On the other hand if it's not legally binding it's nothing illegal ride tomorrow, but Jason's you have no rights. So is my promise to you to hold the offer open for two weeks legally binding.
 But once again as you can see the pattern here, how do we know where they're probably good binding the apple. Is it part of a contract contract requires legality capacity consideration and consideration has been Mutual. So take a look at the consideration aspect my promise to hold the offer open to you that's available promise because I'm giving up my right to revoke for that two-week. And that's a very useful thing for you to have so my promise is good consideration.
 What did you give me in exchange? What is the bargain for exchange that you gave me in exchange for my promise? I'll do after open.
 What is it?
 Guess would be promising to buy the car and that too weak. For sure but you can sell the stuff that you were trying to sell. That's why you wanted the option contract. If he was sure he could sell the stuff that you would just accept the contract offer, but you weren't sure so you never promised to buy so maybe a down payment then if she gave me down payment, but you didn't give me that payment you gave me nothing. I gave you a variable promise you gave me nothing in exchange for my example.
 Therefore no Mutual consideration that consideration element is missing and if a my promise is not part of the contract. It's a no legal significance.
 So I can break my promise to you know, and not suffer any consequences. Now, they're still is even though even though the promise to hold the door open is not binding. I still made you a contract offer an effective offer exists, which you can accept.
 however
 Before the moment you accepted and his father Mama contact formation. It's just an offer. And remember the awful Roar has the right to revoke. I have the right to revoke my offer anytime. I want up until the moment of contact formation. And so if you're not accepted yet I call you on the phone. I say Joe. Guess what? I changed my mind and I promise I'll go help him, but I told him I am taking it back. I'm not going to hold you up so I can revoking you offering.
 Has a legal right to do that because I'm not legally bound to keep to keep my promise to hold you offering to you was a gift, is not binding now on the other hand. Let's say that follow up with your question. What if you dip give me something and it says what if we had a bargain for a change when you said that I you what if you will promise to hold you for the two weeks. I'll pay you $50 for that.
 And you get to keep the $50 regardless of whether I end up buying the car not so you're paying me $50 today in exchange for my, so I'm making you today to hold your phone for the two weeks. My promise has value your $50 has value not consideration is present.
 So we have legality. We have capacity of consideration. We have an agreement be a proper formation. We have a binding contract and is a name for this contract is called an option contract and is very use as you can imagine a very useful type of a contract the option contract to hold the offer open.
 I'll give you a quick example of how I use this option contract quite a few years ago.
 Long time ago I had a car for a used car couple year old car, but I wanted a different car. Also another used car.
 Hello to buy the second card. I wanted let's go to because I have a car with a big car. No to buy the bee car. I needed the money from the sale of a car.
 Call Misery by Soul the a car first and got the money.
 I got no car.
 That's why I can't drive around looking for the b car.
 If I didn't sell you a car that I have the money to buy the D car, so I got a dilemma, right?
 so what I did was
 first I kept the a car and I drove around with you a car to find the big car and I found a big car.
 I made a deal with the seller said hook I'll pay you $50 to hold your open the screen weeks. I think it was cuz I figured I could sell my bait car in 3 weeks.
 Second $50 now. I had a contract give me the legal, right?
 To accept that offer and the office or cannot revoke legally for 3 weeks.
 In a few weeks, I'll be able to advertise the a car so the a car get the money for a car and turned by the Bee car so actually happen and it might you might be in the same situation.
 So this option contract is really a very handy tool for you, but you can use in many situations in the way that I actually use it and how many years ago.
 No.
 You should know that in connection with this holding you offer open a promise and all the offer open. There's a thing called that you CeCe from offer. Do you see see the first of Uniform Commercial Code was attempt to modernize the law and it made some changes but the changes that were going to talk about only relate to contract for the sale of goods.
 Can you see see only applies in the contacts were talking about the contract for the sale of goods?
 Good removable physical property so a car is moving physical property.
 Silvercar is contacting the sale of goods there for the ucc-1 apply what the UCC firm offer rule says, is that sometimes?
 Sometimes a gift promise to hold the offer open.
 Is enforceable even though it's just a gift promise and normally under the common law would not be enforceable.
 So sometimes a gift promise enforceable. So when is it uses? He says there are certain requirements.
 If the party promising to hold the offer open is a merchant which for purposes we can say is a dealer.
 So what do you go to a car? Do they go to the say the Ford dealer in town? And there's our baby a used car you want to buy your intention agreement that you would like to buy the car, but I'm not sure if you're going to be able to raise the money and the
 the car dealer for dealer promises to your cat tell you what will hold this car for a week at this price would know if you can come back within a week will sell this particular Car 2 for $5,000.
 So if we have a merchant promising to hold an offer open?
 And importantly if the merchant gives you a signed writing.
 Kirby Whitten now and signed by the merchant, singhal the offer open.
 Then., told the offer open is binding just as if it was part of an option contract, even though it's a gift promise. It is binding just as it was part of an option contract for a maximum of up to three months.
 so this is something exception Under the UCC, and if you were dealing with a dealer if you're buying a car from a dealer and if you
 Like to be sure that the dealer is bound to all the north Walker to make sure to get that sign writing and now you have a legal right to enforce that cops. And if the car dealer breaks a promise, then you can sue the car dealer for any damage you suffered just as you can sue the promise or an option contract that breaks the promise to hold you off road.
 Where is the Provost holy office open?
 unforeseen difficulties
 also creates soil exception sometimes
 how to make a chest for the questions about what we talked about earlier. Yes.
 A merchant and a merchant Merchant was a dealer dealer somebody who routinely sells good to that type. So it's got to be a merchant making a promise in order for the UCC firm offer will to work get the question.
 That's an interesting question. Is it course in to threaten to sue?
 Actually, you can be in some circumstances particularly. If the threat is not justified. They can be held to be the coercion on the other hand are circling the girl sharing over whether or not to bring a lawsuit for example settling that that dispute over slipped on the ice. We talked about this earlier, then it's not Coors and so it depends on whether what it is good faith on the part of the person who is
 play suggesting a lawsuit might be brought it can be corrosion, but not necessarily.
 Okay, unforeseen difficulties. This sometimes comes up.
 what if
 You are a building contractor construction building contractor. Can you enter into a contract to build a house for customer customers name is Joe.
 Joanne's Pizza raw ground and that you agree to build a house that conform to certain Blueprints and descriptions and the you agree to the tire price for your work for materials and labor the total of a $200,000.
 Can you figure that if we're going to make about $40,000 profit on this on this contract?
 To go to the land that role and that you're all his start building the house. First thing I do is dig dig the foundation because the house calls for a basement to digging the foundation and the foundation.
 You strike this incredible Boulder this big rock made out of very very hard extremely hard Granite. They try to chip away with the rock with a pickaxe and and can you make a dent in it to where I going to do?
 Do you consult an expert on excavation experts is up with these kind of rock is only one way to to remove them. It's going to be blasted out with dynamite. And so you check out with various Dynamite blasting companies and you get some competitive bids and the best price you can get to blast out. This rock is the $10,000.
 I'm at area $20,000 to blast out the Rock.
 She figure that goes half your profit.
 So you go back to the customer go back to Jo and say do you know there's a situation we discovered this rock and it's going to cost $20,000 additional money. This rock and it's going to really going to eat away into my profits.
 I will know I will build a house for the originally agreed price but out of furnace don't you think that you should contribute to this unforeseen difficulty and I'll tell you what you say the Joe. It's going to cost me $20,000 for you the estimate I got you know, here's the Moscow blasting company that would have lost their $20,000 absorb half of this extra cost and you've dumped half house that is in a fair. So you agree to pay 210,000.
 stand
 The all the other 10,000 together and that's how I'm going to cover the $20,000 blasting cost. And Joe says, okay.
 I know you're a good honest Builder and you've done very good work and I can see the situation not your fault or share this extra cost and I'll pay $10,000 more Joe says.
 Uneven, and even you make love to have a ride to you print in writing and Joe agrees to pay $10,000 no problem with the writing signatures everything.
 Play the house is finally built and it's built exactly according to the specifications that it's supposed to.
 and come to collect your you're
 50 and Joe hand you a check for $200,000 not 2:10, but 200 say what's this you agreed to pay to Tim and I got it in writing how you pull out the document promise to pay the extra money.
 Joe says, well, you know, I'm over at 6 business long long time ago and
 What does a promise after part of a contract which cries Mutual consideration?
 I did promise to pay you $10,000 extra.
 But you promise somebody to do what you already before he comes to help to existing duty to build a house in that spot that you did. You haven't given me anything new anything additional to what you were already obligated to do and so there's no Mutual consideration here there for my promise me that the $10,000 is a gift promise not binding and having we consider the thought about it. I've decided I'm not going to pay the 10000 and I'm not legally obligated to
 Joe has a point.
 However, this situation came up in a quite a few times in the world about the special rule for it.
 Because it didn't seem fair to you to the building contractor.
 When the gift, this was made because of unforeseen difficulties, that would not my fault.
 And this case. For Singapore. It was not my fault.
 I saw the Lord has made so the exception here and Joe's gift, stoop any different $10,000 will be enforceable. Even though it's a gift, Stephen has number for consideration Joe's gift card to pay the extra $10,000 is enforceable.
 Because of the unforeseen difficulties of an equity kind of a kind of a reason that the courts have imported and apply in these cases where you have an unforeseen difficulties. That is not the fault.
 Call the pharmacy in a situation like this.
 questions on that
 Idaho we're running into a problem like that from The Salted kind of something that you might want if we're in a place where such rocks are common.
 Tell if such rocks are common.
 Then I the building contractor The Constructor should know that.
 And what I should do in a situation like that is I should so in the building site with metal rods and then there's a procedure for doing that in order to discover the presence of such rocks because after all if the rocks are commonly I should foresee. They might be there and I know this going to cost a lot extra money to expedite them. I need to take a reasonable steps to discover the presence of the rock. So we have fluid in the area where such rocks are to be expected. Then I have a duty of confidence to probe and try and discover them.
 Not maybe I did Trove in the proper way. And if I proved in a proper way, I still might have missed the rock. It might be an oddly shaped rocks and the probes just barely missed them on each side. So if I did nothing wrong, once again, if I did exercise reasonable care in confidence and always I do anything wrong.
 And a promise was made because of this unforeseen difficulties. Now, the town's is still binding. But if I was careless if I was negligent and if I failed to do for these rocks in the area where rocks are known to be, now, I am at fault because I failed to be careful and competent in trouble for the Rocks. So in that case Jose promise is a gift promised. They would not be enforced because I was at fault.
 Then that The Rock really was not on foreseeable.
 The Rock really that situation should have been foreseeable and how do I program you to discovered it? So in the case and a situation where rocks are common it depends on whether or not the building contractor has exercised care in properly searching our probing for these rocks and if the building, I've been in contact with not a fault then they get promise is enforceable. Otherwise, it is not yet.
 Would that be the same as like all these houses that fall off cliffs in California all the time? I mean those people cannot go back into the Builder or can they be cuz should the Builder not have seen that there was going to be some structural problem as soon as a train that's a little bit different but I think that in California, Clewiston with the basalt it is well known that in California the Earth is somewhat unstable and that these things happening and mudslides earthquakes and what kinds of problems and show it in a situation like that if they building contractor they have safe code for the quality of the of the earth underneath the building site, but did not send the Builder was at fault and could be sued say later on from negligence or in this case.
 I'm so I could you say it again?
 Iran, Jordan 12
 OK Google, what if the contractor went to jail today? We got this Boulder is going to cost $20,000 and Joe said
 well
 That's unfortunate for you.
 We have a contract you are legally bound to build this house these specifications including the basement in the foundation for $200,000. This is the contract and I'm not going to pay any more.
 Show us winners right there is a contract.
 And Jill cannot force the contractor to pay more the contractor going to be stuck in a situation.
 but if
 Joe does Thomas to pay more in a situation where the big rock was unforeseeable, then that gift, This will be enforceable because they're served exception for unforeseen difficulties. We were talking about the question. Thank you.
 If I let me say a word about the last Topic in connection with consideration, which is a promise to pay a liquidated debt. First of all, the term liquidated is a term that we're going to encounter in the future.
 The term liquidated means that it is fixed and known the no doubt about it. It's a certain amount.
 So let's say I lent you $1,000 last year.
 Can we have a loan contract that requires you to pay me back $1,000 today?
 Your debt is $1,000. It is fixed and of no dispute about no question about it. You're not denying it.
 We agree that you owe me $1,000 due today that is a liquidated debt.
 know if we have such a liquidated that
 maybe you come to me and you say
 Jerry I know I owe you $1,000 today, but I really can't pay you the full thousand cuz I've had some financial difficulties, but I can pay a 900 would you accept 900 as for payment. This faction for the day?
 What if I say? Okay fine, I'll take the 900.
 If I take a 900 as 4 satisfaction, what I'm doing is I am forgiving or excusing the 100 that you're not paying.
 In fact, I'm promising to forgive that amount that I'm promising not to try and collect it.
 Is my promise?
 Not to try and collect the other hundred of binding promise it goes back to consideration.
 When I promise to forgive $100 a debt that's value to you. That's a viable promise to you. You're getting $100 forgiven. It's just if I gave you $100, what are you giving me an exchange? Why you give me 900 but got a pre-existing duty to give me nine hundred more so you're not giving me anything new.
 Show my promise to forgive the unpaid hundred dollars is a gift promise.
 No Mutual consideration not part of the contract not binding for no contract there.
 Because the amount was liquidated on the other hand. What if the amount is not liquidated? What if there's a disagreement over how much you owe me?
 Maybe the thousand dollars is a debt because I fixed your car. I rebuilt the engine your car, but you feel that I did bad job that it still smokes a lot that have power and you think are thinking you think I'm not entitled to a falcon because I didn't do a hundred percent good job, and you off limit is 500.
 thesaurus settle
 What are you know what you owe?
 Now that that is not liquidated and if I agree to accept 500 forgive 500, I am getting something in return because it's not certain that I haven't had anything. And so you were giving me some consideration. I'll give you a consideration for the promise to forgive. The 500 is good consideration is mutual consideration there and that promise is buying so what about the promise to forgive an unpaid a map is binding or not depends on whether or not the debt is liquidated or not. Okay. See you in a few.
